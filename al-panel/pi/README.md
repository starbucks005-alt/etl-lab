# AL panel server (runs on AL's Pi)

Status: written 2026-10-01. The server logic was tested with a stand-in for
`al.py`. It has NOT been run on AL's hardware, and the Claude photo call and the
eye lights are untested.

## What is here
- `al_panel_server.py` serves the panel and its buttons (eyes, accent, skills, chat, photos).
- `al_eyes.py` drives the two eye rings from GPIO12. It needs the rings wired.
- `make_samples.py` records one sample clip per accent, for the website demo.

## Setup on the Pi
1. Make a folder: `mkdir -p ~/al_panel`
2. Put `al_panel_server.py` and `al_eyes.py` in it, and the panel page from
   `al-panel/index.html` as `~/al_panel/index.html`.
3. Install Flask: `sudo apt install -y python3-flask`
4. Start the server: `python3 ~/al_panel/al_panel_server.py`
5. On a phone or laptop on the same network, open `http://<AL's address>:8000`.
   The status pill should say "Connected to AL".

## Eyes (after the rings are wired)
1. `sudo apt install -y python3-pip` then `sudo pip3 install rpi_ws281x --break-system-packages`
2. `sudo python3 ~/al_panel/al_eyes.py`
3. If it complains about the Pi's own audio, turn that off with `dtparam=audio=off`
   in `/boot/firmware/config.txt` and restart. That is flagged in the build brief.

## Motion sensor (after the sensor is wired)
Not run on AL yet. The signal wire goes to GPIO13, the second signal pin of the HAT's
GPIO12 socket, because the pins under the HAT are not reachable. Which wire of the cable
is GPIO13 has to be found with a meter before it is connected (see the build brief).
Power the sensor from the 5V supply, not from the cable.
1. Check the wiring first: `python3 ~/al_panel/al_motion.py`, wait for "Ready", then wave
   a hand in front of the dome. Press Ctrl+C when done. Do not leave it running: it
   holds GPIO13, and the panel server needs that pin.
2. The panel server now reads the sensor itself. After a minute of warm-up, the panel
   says "Her motion sensor is working".
3. In the panel, card 8 "When someone walks up" picks what AL does (say hello, turn her
   head, brighten her eyes) and how long she waits before welcoming again. The choices
   are saved in `welcome.json` next to the server and are not cleared by Reset.
   "Welcome now" does the same thing by hand, for when the sensor misses someone.
4. If the sensor is not connected the panel says so, and everything else keeps working.
   `sudo apt install -y python3-gpiozero` if the library is missing.

## Neck (after the servo board is wired)
Not run on AL yet. The PCA9685 board takes its two data wires from the HAT's I2C socket.
Measure that socket's power pin with a meter before connecting the board's logic power.
1. `sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-servokit --break-system-packages`
2. `i2cdetect -y 1` should show 40 once the board is connected.
3. With the head OFF the servo: `python3 ~/al_panel/al_neck.py --test` does one small
   glance and stops.
4. `python3 ~/al_panel/al_neck.py` waits for the panel server to ask for a glance.
   The head is limited to 60 degrees each side of the middle. One motion sensor cannot
   tell where a person is, so the head makes a small glance and comes back; it does not aim.

## Limits and notes
- Eye brightness is capped at 30 percent of the lights' full power, in two places.
- Photos are held in memory only and are never saved.
- The accent voices are Astra-9's five, from `good-company/gc-friend.js`.
- A page on the secure website cannot reach AL on the local network, so open the panel from AL's own address.

## Real voices in the website demo
The website version cannot use live voices (Good Company's demo allowance is about
3 spoken replies per visitor per day). Instead:
1. On the Pi: `python3 ~/al_panel/make_samples.py` makes five clips in `~/al_panel/audio/`.
2. Copy them to a laptop, for example: `scp terryoroszi@192.168.0.87:~/al_panel/audio/*.mp3 .`
3. Upload the five files to `al-panel/audio/` on `main` (GitHub's web page works).
   Keep the names exactly: `accent-robot.mp3`, `accent-american.mp3`, `accent-swedish.mp3`,
   `accent-british.mp3`, `accent-indian.mp3`.
The panel plays them, and falls back to the device voice if a clip is missing.
